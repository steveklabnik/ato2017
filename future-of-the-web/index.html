# A vision of the future for the Web Platform

By @steveklabnik

(slides made extra awesome by @ag_dubs)

class: center, middle

# Agenda

1. A short history of the Web
2. What is "the web platform"?
3. Where are we going? (wasm)

# A short history of the Web

---
class: center, middle

### In the beginning

## There was HTML

### And it was good

---
class: center, middle

> August 6, 1991, the first web site goes live

> CSS was first proposed by H√•kon Wium Lie on October 10, 1994.

---
class: center, middle

> JavaScript was created in in May 1995 by Brendan Eich.

---
class: center, middle

The core technologies of the web were set 22 years ago.

---
class: center, middle

> The first version of mod_perl was written by Gisle Aas and released on
> March 25, 1996.

> CGI, the "Common Gateway Interface", proposed in 1993, standardized
> in 2004.

More stuff *has* happened, but mostly *refinement*, rather than *revolution*.

---
class: center, middle

There is a precursor, though: the rediscovery of JavaScript.

---

# What is "the web platform"?

It should be "the web *application* platform."

---
class: center, middle

Platforms consist of:

1. An ISA (instruction set architecture)
2. A runtime environment and its API
3. Tooling to help you build stuff

---
class: center, middle

# Case study: UNIX on x86

1. ISA: x86
2. Runtime: UNIX (wait what?)
3. Tooling: shell, C, gcc

---
class: center, middle

# Case study: Java

1. ISA: Java Bytecode
2. Runtime: JVM
3. Tooling: javac

---
class: center, middle

### The web platform is unusual in that it was developed
## out of order
### and it historically has had
## missing pieces

---
class: center, middle

Other platforms were local, then networked.

The web platform is networked, and only now becoming local.

---
class: center, middle

The browser was a *viewport* into an *application on the server*.

---
class: center, middle

This limits the kind of applications that we can build on the web
platform.

---
class: center, middle

# Where are we going?

---
class: center, middle

Further developing the web platform's capabilities requires
filling in the missing pieces.

---
class: center, middle

# Case study: Web Platform

1. ISA: ???
2. Runtime: JavaScript + Platform APIs
3. Tooling: So so so so so many

---
class: center, middle

JavaScript as ISA?

Sort of, but not *really*.

---
class: center, middle

JavaScript was not designed for this task.

"Compile to JS" works, but has significant drawbacks.

---
class: center, middle

* Overhead
  * Download
  * Parse
  * Compile
  * Execute
* No integers?
* Too complex (885 pages)

---
class: center, middle

# Enter WebAssembly

1. ISA: **WebAssembly**
2. Runtime: JavaScript + Platform APIs
3. Tooling: So so so so so many

Spec: 165 pages

---
class: center, middle

Previously, the web could only handle *high level* tasks.

With wasm, the web platform can handle *low level* tasks.

---
class: center, middle

The Web Platform is closing in on application spaces previously only possible
on other platforms.

---
class: center, middle

### Aside: isn't this Java Applets?

# NO

* One VM
* Not tied to one language
* Proper platform integration

---
class: center, middle

It's not just about wasm, it's also about the platform expanding:

* WebGL
* WebAudio
* WebUSB (!)

---
class: center, middle

Soon, "web application" does not need to be synonymous with "networked
application" or "web page" or anything else we associate with the web
platform today.

---
class: center, middle

Let's go back to an earlier slide:

TODO

---
class: center, middle

SPAs shifted *some* of the application to the client.

This work enables *all* of the application to be on the client.

---
class: center, middle

Why is this useful?

Universal, cross-platform applications.

"no install neccesary"

---
class: center, middle

What *is* WebAssembly, anyway?

Extremely misunderstood üôÅ

# Factorial

Wasm is a compact, binary format:

```text
20 00 42 00 51 04 7e 42 01 05 20
00 20 00 42 01 7d 10 00 7e 0b
```

class: center, middle

# Factorial

It also has a text format, so you can "view source" easily.
