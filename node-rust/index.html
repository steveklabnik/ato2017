# X in Node is Y in Rust
## A guide to Rust for Javascript developers

By @steveklabnik

(slides made extra awesome by @ag_dubs)

This talk is a *high-level guide* to various projects in the *Rust*
ecosystem, drawing comparisons to the *Node.js* ecosystem.

> Rust is cool, but I don't know what to use it for.

Rust can do many things, including some things JavaScript cannot do.

But, to get started, why not use it to do the things you already know how to do?
